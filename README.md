# REFACTOR FIT LIT
### Abstract
This was a group project that involved building on a mostly functional application and implementing new features. As a group, we refactored code to utilize inheritence, make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.

This is a fitness and wellnewss app that users can update and view steps walked, water consumed, hours slept and steps walked. Users can compare data with their friends as well.
### SetUp

1) Clone down the repository button and copy the link
2) Cd into the project
3) Run `npm install`.
4) Run `npm test` to see tests pass.
5) If you would like to view spi testing, run, `npm install chai-spies`
6) If you are having issues with moment, used for the current date run `npm install moment.js`
7) Run 'npm start' and look for  "Project is running at http://localhost:8080/". Copy the url into your browser.
### Wins
* Accessibility: audited the url with Lighthouse. The rating began at 35 and was raised to 100.
* Working with webpack, to allow for more efficient files.
* Sass for drying up code
* Chai-spies to test DOM manipulation
### Challenges
* Learning how to approach a project with minimal direction.
* We had to apply new knowledge, which was difficult at times.
